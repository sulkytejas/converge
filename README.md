## ⚠️ DigitalOcean migration — WIP notes (read me first)

> Running log captured during the AWS→DigitalOcean migration. **The sections
> below this one are stale** and will be rewritten from scratch using these
> notes once the migration lands. Treat this section as the current truth.

**Target:** DigitalOcean App Platform (Next.js) + Managed MySQL 8 + Spaces (S3-compatible storage).

### Done so far
- **DB model changes** — renames done via Prisma `@map`/`@@map` (DB names `cp_user`, `approved_by_cp_user_id`, `duolingo`, `min_entry_req`, `needs_edu_loan`; the Prisma/code names are unchanged), `tinyint(1)` flag conversions, NOT NULL tightenings, `unsigned`/`decimal` adjustments. **`prisma/sql/schema.sql` stays the source of truth.**
- **File storage → Spaces** — `src/server/storage/` auto-selects Spaces (prod) vs local disk (dev). Public university logos → permanent CDN URL; private docs/avatars/org-logos → object key served only through the gated **`/api/files/[...key]`** proxy (admins: any; partners: own org). Throws in prod if `SPACES_*` unset (no silent ephemeral-disk writes).
- **Security** — partners admin router now requires admin auth; OTP fails loudly in prod if MSG91 unset (no sandbox/code-logging fallback); email OTP moved to a DB table (`otp_code`) with attempt cap + resend cooldown + hashing; login no longer leaks account existence; **`/api/upload`** gated (folder allowlist + per-folder session + magic-byte MIME + per-IP rate limit).
- **Build** — all ESLint build-blockers fixed.
- **Schema-apply tooling (B2)** — `npm run db:diff` (generate a reviewable delta) + `npm run db:apply` (apply pending deltas, tracked in `schema_migrations`; idempotent, localhost-guarded, TLS for remote). Verified end-to-end (apply → re-run skips).
- **DB connectivity** — `src/server/db.ts` handles Managed MySQL TLS (B4); Prisma `binaryTargets` include the Linux engine; connection-pool cap.
- **Transactional email** — **MSG91** for non-OTP mail too (admin signup notify, partner more-info) via `src/server/email.ts`; gated on per-email template IDs, degrades to a minimal non-PII log until set.
- **Hardening** — account-status re-checked on every protected request (deactivation is immediate), upload/zip DoS guards, no PII in logs, list queries bounded (cap 500 — cursor pagination is the follow-up), `/api/health` DB ping.

### Schema-change workflow (SQL-first; Prisma generated downstream)
1. Riana edits the model in **MySQL Workbench** → **Forward Engineer → SQL** → commits it over `prisma/sql/schema.sql` (optionally commit the `.mwb` under `prisma/sql/workbench/` for history), then regenerate the Prisma client.
2. `npm run db:diff [name]` — diffs the current DB against `schema.sql`, writes a reviewable delta to `prisma/sql/migrations/`. Whoever opens the PR runs this and commits the generated delta **alongside** the `schema.sql` change in the **same PR**, so the schema change and its migration are reviewed together.
3. **Review the delta** — diff tools render a rename as `DROP`+`ADD` (data loss). Convert those to `RENAME`/`CHANGE` by hand before applying.
4. `npm run db:apply` — applies pending deltas in order, tracked in `schema_migrations`; idempotent, localhost-guarded, TLS for remote hosts (`MYSQL_SSL_CA`). Fresh DBs: load full `schema.sql` first (`npm run db:reset` in dev; one-time TLS load for the prod bootstrap).

### New env vars (see `.env.example`)
`SPACES_*` (storage), `DATABASE_CA_CERT` (Managed MySQL TLS), `MSG91_ADMIN_NOTIFY_TEMPLATE_ID` / `MSG91_MOREINFO_TEMPLATE_ID` (transactional email). **Email provider = MSG91** for OTP *and* transactional mail (not AWS SES). In production the app fails loud if `MSG91_*` or `SPACES_*` are missing (no silent fallback).

### Still TODO before prod testing
- **B4** — Managed MySQL TLS (`?sslaccept` + CA) in `DATABASE_URL` + `src/server/db.ts`.
- **H5** — commit `.do/app.yaml` (build/run commands, `http_port`, instance size, env→secrets, MySQL attachment).
- **H3/H4** — set a distinct `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` + fresh `AUTH_SECRET` on DO; never ship the local `.env`.
- **M2** Prisma `binaryTargets` (Linux); **M3** `/api/health` DB ping.
- Plug in real `SPACES_*` + `MSG91_*` creds and smoke-test uploads, OTP delivery, DB connectivity.

## Getting Started

You have two options. **Pick the dev container path** unless you have a reason to install everything natively.

### Option A — Dev container (recommended)

One-time host install: **Docker Desktop** + **VS Code** + the **Dev Containers** extension. Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sulkytejas/converge.git
cd converge
code .
```

VS Code will detect `.devcontainer/` and prompt **"Reopen in Container"** — click it. The first build takes a few minutes (downloading the Node + MySQL images). After that:

- `npm install` has run
- `.env` was created from `.env.example`
- The MySQL container is up at host `db:3306` (also forwarded to host `localhost:3306`)
- Schema from `prisma/sql/schema.sql` is applied
- The Prisma client is generated

Open the integrated terminal and run `npm run dev`. App is available at `http://localhost:3000`.

To enable real OTP delivery, fill in the `MSG91_*` keys in `.env`. Without them, OTPs are logged to the server console (sandbox mode).

### Option B — Native setup

Prerequisites: Node.js 20+, npm 10+, Docker (for the MySQL container), Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sulkytejas/converge.git
cd converge
npm install
cp .env.example .env
./start-database.sh        # boots a local MySQL 8 container
npm run db:reset           # applies schema + generates Prisma client
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

`.env.example` is the source of truth. Currently:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/converge"

# MSG91 (OTP provider — leave empty for sandbox: OTPs print to server log)
MSG91_AUTH_KEY=""
MSG91_SMS_TEMPLATE_ID=""
MSG91_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_ID=""
MSG91_EMAIL_FROM=""
MSG91_EMAIL_DOMAIN=""

ADMIN_EMAIL=""
```

Variables are validated at startup by Zod (`src/env.js`). Set `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1` to bypass the check during builds.

> Inside the dev container, `DATABASE_URL` is overridden by `.devcontainer/compose.yml` to point at the `db` service. Your `.env` is left untouched so the native-path workflow keeps working.

---

## Testing the UI

The dev DB seed (`prisma/sql/seed.sql`) adds a dummy admin so the admin flow works end-to-end on a fresh `npm run db:reset:force`. Without `MSG91_*` keys configured, OTPs print to the server log instead of being delivered (sandbox mode).

- **Admin login** (`/admin/login`) — phone-only OTP, gated by an email→phone match in the DB.
  - Seed user: `admin@collegepond.com` / `+91 9876543210`
  - Watch the server log for `[OTP:sandbox] SMS to 919876543210 => <code>`
  - Lands on `/admin/dashboard`.
- **Admin dashboard** (`/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/students`, `/admin/partners`, `/admin/universities`, `/admin/users`, `/admin/settings`, ...) — placeholder pages inside the shared sidebar+topbar shell.
- **Partner signup** (`/signup`) — full multi-step flow; uploads accept any file; the user gets persisted to the `user` table with `status = under_review`.
- **Partner login** (`/login`) — sign up first, then sign in with that email + phone. Email-OTP verified, phone-OTP sent but not verified yet. On success the response carries a `redirectUrl` based on partner state:
  - `under_review` / `rejected` / `inactive` → `/pending-verification` (warning page)
  - `approved` + MOU not signed → `/mou-signing` (4-step accept + canvas signature; partner must complete this)
  - `approved` + MOU signed → `/partner/dashboard`
- **Partner dashboard** (`/partner/dashboard`, `/partner/students`, `/partner/uni-assist`, `/partner/commission`, `/partner/resources`, `/partner/events`) — placeholder pages inside the shared sidebar+topbar shell. `last_login_at` is recorded on every dashboard mount (not on login itself).

## Planned scope

The sections below describe the target product — not all of it is implemented yet. Track the actual state via git history and the `src/app/admin/(dashboard)` route stubs.

### Feature modules

1. **Partner Registration & Onboarding** — multi-step form with OTP verification, document upload, admin approval. *(signup flow partially implemented; admin approval is dev-only)*
2. **Authentication & RBAC** — OTP login backed by a session table; roles enforced inside tRPC. *(OTP flow exists; session layer not yet wired)*
3. **MOU / Terms signing** — digital signature via Digio/Leegality on first admin login.
4. **Dashboard** — role-appropriate metrics and quick actions. *(shell scaffolded; content TBD)*
5. **Student Management** — profiles, academic history, documents, application timeline.
6. **Application Management** — status lifecycle from Draft to Enrolled, with notification triggers.
7. **University & Program Finder** — searchable directory with entry requirements and commissions.
8. **Commission Tracking** — tier, rates, history, payout schedule.
9. **Bank Details & Payouts** — cancelled cheque upload, account verification.
10. **Contracts** — view/download active MOUs.
11. **Team Management (Admin)** — add counselors/managers, send credentials.
12. **Notification Preferences** — per-channel delivery cadence.
13. **Education Loan Assistance** — initiate loan requests against a student.
14. **Excel Reports** — server-generated via ExcelJS.

### Roles

- **Admin** — full access across counselors, commissions, payments, team
- **Manager** — read-most across the partner org
- **Counselor** — own students and applications only
